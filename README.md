#PROJECT 4: Mobile Web Specialist Restaurant Reviews App: Stage 1

This project is the updated version of [Restaurants Reviews](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git) as we're asked the missing functionalities. We basically were asked to make sure that this application works online and offline-first at the same time. We had also to make it responsive to all kinds of devices. In addition, we're asked to also use the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) in order to provide accessibilities to everyone. Globally, this application provides not only responsiveness, online and offline access, but it also provides accessibilities to everyone include the persons with disabilities. 

##How to run it:
    
#*First of all, you have to make these commands from your terminal:
    
    *   Because we will be running this program with Python, we have to make sure it's installed. Check which Python's version it's installed on your computer:
    `python -V`
    
    *   For version Python 2.x, run this from terminal:
    `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

    *   For version Python 3, run this:
    ` python3 -m http.server 8000`

    *   To explore the application, please go to your browser and paste click:
[yourLocalHost](http://localhost:8000)


#####   Note: I will recommend to use Chrome Canary for the most recent updates. Aslo, remember to download Python just in case it's not                    installed on your local machine.
